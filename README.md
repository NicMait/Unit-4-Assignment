The tests should be run individually using the scripts in the package.json.

For the SignUp test, once the test is run the first time then the user would become an existing customer. To run multiple time the email address can be switched to a new one.

The UNHAPPY PATH test is done in SignUp.e2e.js.It is the second test. Comment out the first test and uncomment the second test before running it.

To execute in Firefox please uncomment firefox in the package.json and comment out chrome.
